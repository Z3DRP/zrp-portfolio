# Zach Palmer Portfolio

# Description
This is my portfolio app's fronend. I was going to write this in Htmx, Go, Temple, and Vanillia Js but I decided to use React and Vite.
My idea is to have the About Me page be my main landing page for my domain then have pages that link to other projects of mine. 
The About Me page shows some information about me, my experience, my skills, my zypher tool, and a schedule component that shows my weekly
availability and lets users request a time to speak with me. It is currently not completely finished but is getting there.
